<h1> Simple Shell with C </h1>

# A simple UNIX command interpreter that provides a user interface to access and give orders to the operating system.

## Description

A <b>simple shell</b> is a command-line interface that allows a user to interact with a computer system using textual commands. It is a program that provides a basic set of functions for executing commands, managing files, and performing other system operations.
<br />
In essence, a simple shell is a simple implementation of a command-line interface, similar to the one provided by popular operating systems like Linux, Unix, and macOS. The shell provides a command prompt, which is a textual interface that allows the user to enter commands and interact with the system. The shell then interprets these commands and executes the appropriate programs or system calls to carry out the requested tasks.
<br />
A simple shell typically includes a set of built-in commands for basic operations like navigating the file system, creating and deleting files, and managing processes. It can also execute external programs and scripts, allowing the user to perform more complex tasks.

Some common features of a simple shell include:
<ul>
   <li> Command history: The ability to store and recall previously executed commands.
   <li> Tab completion: The ability to complete partially typed commands using the tab key.
   <li> I/O redirection: The ability to redirect input and output streams to files or other programs.
   <li> Background processing: The ability to run programs in the background while continuing to use the shell.
</ul><br />
A simple shell can be implemented in a variety of programming languages, including C, Python, and Bash. It is a useful tool for developers, system administrators, and power users who want to interact with the system at a low level and perform tasks quickly and efficiently.
